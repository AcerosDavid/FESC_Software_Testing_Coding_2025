Python_Code_Refactoring_SOLID_2025
üìå Overview

This repository contains an educational project focused on code analysis, refactoring in Python, and the application of SOLID principles, along with best practices for project setup and environment management.
It is based on a theoretical and practical document prepared for academic purposes in 2025.

The project includes:

Analysis and refactoring of Python code.

Explanation and application of SOLID principles.

Guidelines for structuring Python projects and managing environments.

üéØ Objectives

Understand the importance of refactoring and clean code practices.

Apply SOLID principles to design more maintainable and extensible systems.

Learn to properly configure and structure a Python project environment.

Provide a theoretical foundation complemented with practical examples.

üõ† Part 1: Code Analysis & Refactoring

The initial example consisted of a simple program that receives two values separated by a comma: a number and a string. The system checks if the number falls within a valid range (0‚Äì150).

Issues Identified

Lack of clarity and readability.

Weak validation of inputs.

Poor error handling.

Best Practices Applied

Use descriptive variable names.

Validate inputs to prevent unexpected errors.

Handle errors explicitly.

Apply the Single Responsibility Principle to ensure each function does one clear task.

Benefits: Cleaner, safer, and easier-to-maintain code.

üèó Part 2: SOLID Principles in Action ‚Äì Notification System

One of the case studies is the design of a notification system (Email, SMS, Push). Without careful planning, such systems can become rigid and hard to maintain.

Principles Applied

SRP (Single Responsibility Principle): Each notification type has its own role.

OCP (Open/Closed Principle): The system can be extended with new notifications without modifying existing code.

DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle): High-level modules depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.

Benefits

Extensible and maintainable system.

Reduced risk of breaking existing code when adding new features.

Modular and scalable design.

üìÇ Part 3: Project Setup & Environment Management

When starting a Python project, proper setup is essential to avoid the typical ‚Äúit only works on my machine‚Äù problem.

Recommended Practices

Virtual Environments: Isolate project dependencies to prevent conflicts.

Requirements File: List all libraries in a requirements.txt file so the environment can be easily replicated.

Environment Separation:

Development: Debugging enabled, detailed logs.

Production: Optimized for security and performance.
