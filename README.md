üìå Python Code Analysis, Refactoring, and SOLID Principles

This document covers three key aspects of Python development:

Code Analysis & Refactoring ‚Äì Best practices for writing clean, robust, and maintainable code.

SOLID Principles in Action ‚Äì Applying object-oriented design principles to build flexible systems.

Project Setup & Environment Management ‚Äì Structuring a Python project to avoid common pitfalls.

üîπ 1. Code Analysis and Refactoring

The analyzed code receives two values separated by a comma: a number and a string. It then verifies whether the number falls within a valid range (0‚Äì150).

The original version had issues such as:

Lack of clarity and readability.

Poor validation of inputs.

Weak error handling.

Best Practices Applied:

Use descriptive and meaningful variable names.

Validate inputs to avoid unexpected behaviors.

Handle errors explicitly.

Follow the principle of single responsibility: each function should perform one clear task.

This approach increases readability, prevents bugs, and makes the code easier to maintain.

üîπ 2. Applying SOLID Principles ‚Äì Notification System

In software development, it is common to implement user notifications through channels like email, SMS, or push notifications. Without good design, the system can easily become rigid and hard to extend.

SOLID Principles Applied:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each notification type is handled by a separate component.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The system allows the addition of new notification types without modifying existing logic.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations.

Benefits:

Easy to extend and maintain.

Reduces the risk of breaking existing functionality when adding new features.

Encourages clean, modular design.

üîπ 3. Project Setup & Environment Management

A well-organized project avoids the typical ‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù issue. Proper setup ensures smooth collaboration and easier deployment.

Key Practices:

Virtual Environment: Keeps dependencies isolated from other projects, preventing conflicts.

Requirements File (requirements.txt): Lists all dependencies, allowing anyone to replicate the environment easily.

Environment Separation:

Development environment: Flexible, with debugging and detailed logs enabled.

Production environment: Secure, optimized for performance, with minimal logging.

Recommended Project Structure:

A clear separation between source code, tests, and configuration files.

Consistent naming conventions.

Inclusion of essential files such as README.md, .gitignore, and requirements.txt.
